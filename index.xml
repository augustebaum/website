      <description>This is a summary of my experience of the weekend on interpretability I spent from 2023-05-27 morning to 2023-05-28 evening. This was organized in Paris by EffiSciences.
Saturday Morning We got an introduction to AI risk and the idea of interpretability was introduced as a possible way to counter Goal Misgeneralization, whereby an AI can end up pursuing a goal that is different from the one that was intended, because it found a proxy to the &amp;ldquo;right solution&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last post we tried to make a Python project fully reproducible based on a detailed requirements.txt file. We ended up not managing to go the full Nix way, but we got pretty close. However, there are many ways to approach this, with language-specific tools getting published and archived on the regular.
At the end of the last post I mentioned dream2nix and their &amp;ldquo;Build your Python project in 10 minutes&amp;rdquo; tutorial which I would try out in a future post.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is less of a tutorial and more of a record of my past experience&amp;mdash;in particular, I end up not reaching my stated goal for this post.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading this book on Hypermedia Systems, and one of the things they do is develop a small CRUD application in Python for which the code can be found here. Like the good software citizens they are, they&amp;rsquo;ve included a full detailed list of their project dependencies as a requirements.</description>
