      <description>Last post we tried to make a Python project fully reproducible based on a detailed requirements.txt file. We ended up not managing to go the full Nix way, but we got pretty close. However, there are many ways to approach this, with language-specific tools getting published and archived on the regular.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading this book on Hypermedia Systems, and one of the things they do is develop a small CRUD application in Python for which the code can be found here. Like the good software citizens they are, they&amp;rsquo;ve included a full detailed list of their project dependencies as a requirements.</description>
