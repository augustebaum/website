      <p>A few weeks ago I was proven right. I didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>When I was young I played video games a fair amount. My history with screens started early on, when I watched TV in the morning before going to school. One day, I found an old Game Boy Advance with a cartridge in. I don&rsquo;t remember what the game was, though it might have been Super Mario Advance. The screen was hard to see. After struggling with it for a while, I asked someone to help and they changed the batteries. After that I did see the screen better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to even think of what other games I played. I remember playing a lot of Pokemon on the DS and some Minecraft. I had a PS2 for a while (with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy">Eye-Toy</a>!) and I remember that time fondly, but then I got a Wii and from that point my memory is fading. In particular, I never had a strong affinity for beefy PCs and later gaming consoles, perhaps because of the cost and also because when I played with my friends who had such devices, it was often competitive games and I never won.</p>
<p>However, before all this, I used to make my own platformer games on paper, usually sticky notes. I&rsquo;d draw pipes and imagine I was entering the level and would have to follow the drawn path to the end.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/game-note.png" alt="Artist&rsquo;s rendition of what my games must have looked like"></p>
<p>These days I look back to those times and try to remember what it was like to be more spontaneous and creative. I seem to have very well integrated the rules and will generally refrain from activities that don&rsquo;t have a plan. I guess many people are like that as well, to a certain extent.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other day, I was staying at my friend&rsquo;s house and he offered to play Grand Theft Auto V, as he had recently re-discovered it with his brother. I&rsquo;d heard of the series but hardly knew anything about it beyond the memes. He handed me the controller and went &ldquo;Go to town!&rdquo;.
The first thing I did was get in my car and start driving. A red light showed up; I stopped. After a few seconds, my friend told me that I didn&rsquo;t have to stop, that it was okay. I was floored. For a few more minutes, I could feel how difficult it was to have both of the objectives &ldquo;always follow the rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;do anything you want in GTA V&rdquo; active in my mind at the same time. It is scary to me.</p>
<p>That reminds me of an &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; I did on the internet where my mouse pointer&rsquo;s direction was inverted for a few minutes (i.e. moving the physical mouse right made the pointer move left), then it was inverted back and it felt all weird: my brain had adapted to the inversion quickly and somewhat durably. The experiment was meant to inform users of how your behavior can be influenced by social media. I&rsquo;ll link it here if I can find it.</p>
<p>More generally, I am not surprised that <a href="https://twitter.com/ebengerjohn/status/1230205582478458880?lang=en">most people take the Good Guy option</a> in games, when given the choice. By the way I know that last tweet from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzF7aHxk4Y4">Hbomberguy&rsquo;s video on Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>I think gaming could be a good way for me to obtain more agency and curiosity. Just need to buy the whole setup&hellip;</p>
